# ML-Forest-Cover-Prediction



Kaggle competition link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction

The objective of this project is to predict the forest cover type based on geographical and geological features. 
· Extensive exploration of the dataset
· Feature engineering to create meaningful combinations of the distance measurements 
· Various classification algorithms were tested before deciding that RandomForest and ExtraTrees are the best classifiers for this problem 
· GridSearch was utilized to find the best hyperparameters for these models
· The final model uses ExtraTreesClassifer and achieved a cross-validated accuracy of 82.6%.

Result: Top 100 on the Kaggle leaderboard
